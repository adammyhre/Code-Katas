# Look And Say Sequence

The "look and say" sequence is defined as follows: beginning with the term `1`, each subsequent term visually describes the digits appearing in the previous term. The first few terms are as follows:
```
1
11
21
1211
111221
```
As an example, the fourth term is `1211`, since the third term consists of one `2` and one `1`.

Given an integer N, print the Nth term of this sequence.
