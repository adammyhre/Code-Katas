# Search without Multiplication, Division, or Bit Shifting

Given a sorted list of integers of length N, determine if an element x is in the list without performing any multiplication, division, or bit-shift operations. Do this in O(log N) time.

Sample data:
```csharp
int[] sortedList = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 };
```
