# Rotate a List by K Elements

Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. 
For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] rotated by two becomes [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]. 
Assume a positive k indicates a left (counterclockwise) rotation as shown in the example.  

Try solving this without creating a copy of the list. 
How many swap or move operations do you need?  

Bonus points if your solution can handle a negative k (clockwise) rotation as well.
